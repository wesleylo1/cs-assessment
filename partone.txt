Insert using the unshift method
Append using the push method



Extra large array:

insert 989.341522 ms <-- slower
append 3.591451 ms

Large array:

insert 6.441323 ms <-- slower
append 629.997 μs

Medium array: 

insert 165.704 μs <-- slower
append 145.783 μs

Small array: 

insert 50.175 μs <-- faster
append 108.407 μs

Tiny array: 

insert 37.849 μs <-- faster
append 88.739 μs


The function using the unshift method is faster up until the medium array, which has an array size of 1000. After medium, the difference between the two functions became more drastic. The function using the push method scales a lot better, seemingly to be more linear or consistent with the increase in time to run.
